<h1>Lender-be</h1>

A "social lending" site. Users can list any items they have that they are willing to lend. Friends, family, and neighbors can connect and  can search to see if someone has something you they need, from a book to a power tool. 
Good idea to have rating for users? <-- stretch goal
People can request to borrow and then there is a record of who has the item and a field where the borrower puts how long they need it and another where the lender can put when they need it back and the app can send reminders of the "due date." 
Can we make the menu on the landing page (where it says "book" now) a drop down menu representing the categories?

<h3>MVP</h3>
<ul>
-Database of things that people want to borrow/lend. Includes table of users, categories of items, and a table for each category.
-First drop-down menu takes you to landing page of that category, and then can search on that page. Or browse?
-Search function looks through each item-category table 
-need to be able to search within x miles
-when matching item(s) found, show on map
</ul>
