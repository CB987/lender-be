<h1>Lender-be</h1>

A "social lending" site. Users can list any items they have that they are willing to lend. Friends, family, and neighbors can connect and  can search to see if someone has something they need, from a book to a power tool. 
<br>
People can request to borrow and, if accepted, then there is a record of who has the item, a field where the borrower puts how long they need it, another where the lender can put when they need it back, and the app can send reminders of the "due date." 
<br>
